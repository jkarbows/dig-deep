# What is this?

Originally created as an an entry to the 2015 EMU hackathon, Dig Deep is a first-person game in which the players finds themselves pursued by a dark entity, their only choice to dig deeper in to the dungeon to escape their creeping fate...

We've decided to continue development of Dig Deep to gain experience in distributing a full JavaScript application, as well as in visualising sets of data of three.js for use in future projects.

For the version presented at the hackathon, see [here](http://people.emich.edu/jkarbows/hackathon/).<br>
For the current testing version, see [here](http://people.emich.edu/jkarbows/dig-deep/).

If you're looking for the style guide, it's been moved to [its own repo](https://github.com/jkarbows/javascript-style).
